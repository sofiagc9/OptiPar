# OptiPar
Optical Particle properties determintation 
Calculus of optical properties of shperical or aggregated particles as aerosols or deposited on a surface.

OptiPar is a software developed at the University of Castilla-La Mancha which contains a two-stream radiative transfer model for the determination of optical properties of soot agglomerates and ice particles, as well as snow surfaces contaminated with deposited light absorbing particles. 

More information about the software can be found in the users guide. 

To run the program, the user must download the Programa_OptiPar_autoreflow.mlapp and the others files in the same folder. This is a MATLAB file programmed with the version Matlabb 2021a. Users should not have problems with new versions, but older ones may have not all the characteristics.

To run the program, the user must open the Programa_OptiPar_autoreflow.mlapp in MATLAB and all folders (images, excels, materiales) must be in the path.
